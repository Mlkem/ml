# Consolidation verification — 2026-11-01

- All public Kotlin and Java patch sources compiled against Morphe Patcher 2.1.0.
- Both Java extensions compiled and converted to Android DEX.
- One combined MPP contains JVM patch classes, Android discovery DEX, and both extensions.
- Morphe's real JVM patch loader and official metadata generator discover **23 patches**, covering five named apps and one universal utility.
- **54** Walmart navigation, stock, history, aisle-order and subtotal checks passed locally.
- Metadata checks verify exact app packages, unique patch names, experimental Walmart/PushPress targets, opt-in merge-only, and opt-in experimental Hermes.
- Stable publication correctly refuses to proceed without phone-test approval.
- Workflow YAML and semantic-release configuration parsed successfully.
- No phone installation/import or app UI test was performed in this consolidation.

CI additionally builds with the official Gradle plugin before publishing each beta.
